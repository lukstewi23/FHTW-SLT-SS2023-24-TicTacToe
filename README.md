# FHTW-SLT-SS2023-24-TicTacToe

Welcome to the FHTW-SLT-SS2023-24-TicTacToe project! This project is a modern implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe, developed using Java and Maven.

## Project Description

This project is a part of the FHTW-SLT-SS2023-24 course. It's a simple yet fun game of Tic Tac Toe that you can play in your console. The game is developed using Java, and the project is managed using Maven.

## Automated Tests

We believe in the importance of testing in software development. Therefore, we have written comprehensive tests for the game logic. These tests are run automatically on every push to the repository using GitHub Actions. You can check the status of these tests in the "Actions" tab of the GitHub repository.

## Download the Game

You can download the game as a JAR file from the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository. Here's how:

1. Navigate to the GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "Actions" tab.
3. In the left sidebar, click on the workflow run that corresponds to the push event you're interested in.
4. In the workflow run summary page, scroll down to the "Artifacts" section.
5. Click on the "Testing-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" link to download the JAR file.

The downloaded file will be a ZIP archive that contains the JAR file. You'll need to extract the JAR file from the ZIP archive to use it.

## How to Play

After downloading and extracting the JAR file, you can run the game using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
java -jar Testing-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
